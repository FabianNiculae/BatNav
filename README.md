# BatNav

Concept development
The concept of this project will be focused towards visually impaired persons and their ability to
walk around comfortably. The amount of obstacles indoors and outdoors are increasing day by
day due to the increasing population, starting from simple thrash bins, poles and signs, to all the
furniture like couches, tables or chairs can all pose a great challenge for our target audience
when trying to navigate on their own.
For this problem we came up with BatNav, an obstacle detection sensor system that offers a
wearable device that can alert the user when approaching any obstacle in real time or already
recorded.
Looking at nature, bats are animals that navigate and avoid obstacles by using echolocation. By
sending high frequency soundwaves of 12-160 kHz and then capturing back any sound
reflection if there is an object blocking the way. The echolocation works in nature, so by
mimicking it technologically and using it for visually impaired people it will provide a functional
semi-autonomous system for their navigation needs.
An echolocation device can be designed as a wearable that the target group can incorporate
with ease in their everyday activities, for example having it located around their chest or on their
legs. The device would continuously emit low amplitude ultrasonic sound waves and detect the
distance to the objects that it is facing towards. The wearable will alert the user in the case of an
imminent obstacle in front of them.
This only solves a part of the problem, because people with healthy vision can use photographic
memory to locate themselves in space. After an obstacle is encountered in a certain place, then
that will be easily remembered and seen for the next time they approach it and will be avoided
with ease. Blind persons on the other hand always have to focus more towards avoiding these
obstacles each time, because the only way they can remember their location is by memory, like
counting the number of steps after a certain turn inside a building.
The wearable device would locate the person that is using it indoors or outdoors depending on
the situation. Through feedback, the position of the obstacle can be stored for future visits to the
same place and would even alert the user steps ahead of being detected by the ultrasonic
sensor for a safer guidance. The device would augment the navigation system for visually
impaired people that are currently only using blind canes to navigate their way indoors and
outdoors.
Along with the wearable device, a smartphone application that can store and process the data is
necessary for a complete and semi-autonomous navigation system to be considered usable for
the case described. This is because otherwise the wearable device will need much more
electronic components and hardware to function properly and will also be a lot bigger.
